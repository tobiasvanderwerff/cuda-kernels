The parallel directory contains a refactored version of the serial implementation. 
If you wish to use the code from the serial implementation instead, you can simply copy and paste the contents of the serial directory into the parallel directory.

There is an easy compare script that you can execute using `sh compare.sh`.
When executing, make sure that a `results` directory exists; otherwise the program will segfault. To be sure, it's best to execute `sh compare.sh` first.
